# Getting Started with Rust

Rust is a systems programming language that focuses on safety, speed, and concurrency.

## Why Rust?

1. **Memory Safety**: No null pointer dereferences or buffer overflows
2. **Zero-cost Abstractions**: High-level features don't sacrifice performance
3. **Concurrency**: Built-in support for concurrent programming

## Installation

Install Rust using rustup:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

## Your First Program

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, Rust!");
}
```

Rust makes it easy to write safe and fast code. Give it a try!
